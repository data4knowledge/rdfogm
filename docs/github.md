## Personal Access Token

- Login in to github on the web
- Top right hand menu, choose **Settings**
- Scroll down to **Developer settings**
- Select **Personal access tokens**
- Generate the token and copy and keep somewhere safe

Then

- Run the Mac Keychain Access utility (found in ```Applications\Utility``` directory)
- Search for github.com, double-click
- Choose Show Password
- You will need to enter your macbook password, and enter
- You will be able to see the password now and just paste the token you already generated, and save the changes.

That should be it
